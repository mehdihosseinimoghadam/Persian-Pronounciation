## Persian Pronounce

Python Persian Pronounce is based on Dr. Nawar Halabi's work https://github.com/nawarhalabi/Arabic-Phonetiser. There are some slight changes like adding new characters such as ``` پ چ ژ ```. 

## Usage
```python
persianToBuckwalter("درود")
>>> 'drvd'
```

```python
buckwalterToPersian("drvd")
>>> 'درود'
```
